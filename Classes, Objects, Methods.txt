CLASS -> Is a blueprint or a template of creating objects, it defines attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that object of the class will have. A class serves as a template
from which objects can be created. Class contains methods, constractors and fields or attributes.

-Fields: Are variables that are declared within the class are represent data or the state of the of an object.

-Constructors: Is a special type of method that is used for initializing the objects of a class. Constructors have the same name as the class and they dont return anything and they
are not void methods. They are automatically called when a new object of the class is created using new keyword. We have default constructors and parameterized constructors.

-Methods: Are blocks of code that perform specific tasks or operations within the class. They can have name, return type, parameters, access modifier. There are static methods, instance
methods, overloading methods.
