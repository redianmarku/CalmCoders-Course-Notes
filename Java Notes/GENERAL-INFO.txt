-A programming language -> is a set of instructions written in a hiearchial and logical way that can be compiled and executed by a machine or computer.

-CPU -> processor of the computer is a hardware component that processes arithmetic and logical instructions that travel through buses using adresses in the memory of the computer.
-Adresses -> is a reference of location in the memory of the computer about some data.
-Pointer -> is a variable that stores the memory address.
-Variable -> is a named reference of an address in the memory of the computer that we use to store some value. We can call it or initialize data using it.
-CPU Registers -> are some high speed memory locations in the CPU of the computer that is used to store temporary data while CPU is manipulating instructions.
-Buses -> communication system that transfers data between components of the computer.
-RAM -> Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory that serves as a temporary storage of the data that are used by CPU to run the instructions of a program and keep the program running.

-In computer science counting starts from 0 because it has to do with the way how computer save data in the memory adresses and usually they are index from 0, but this also have to do with
historical reason and mathematical reason. All programming languages start indexing from 0 and not from 1 this started as from the first programming languages like C or C++ which they
usually use pointers to index values or datas and it makes it easier to interact.


-byte-> is a unit of the digital memory that computers use, 1 bite = 8 bit and 1 bit is a 1 or 0 in the computer memory 
-console -> text based interface that can interact with the computer system, you can input commands and view out put in text-based format

-application ->
